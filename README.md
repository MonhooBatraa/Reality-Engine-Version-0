# Marta-Engine-Version-0
My first graphic programming project I write myself instead of copying code from internet or github
I find out there is another game engine project called "Reality Engine" that is unreal engine powered virtual production thing so order to avoid copyright infringement I changed name to Marta the Game Engine.
Marta the Game Engine will be using DirectX12 as it graphic API.
things to add: Assimp to load 3d model and input system for interacting with 3d virtual worlds that is "World of Glory Hearth" where Marta live.
